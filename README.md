## Supabase Setup

1. Create a Supabase project.
2. In Supabase SQL Editor, run `supabase/schema.sql`.
3. If an earlier Web Push build was deployed, run `supabase/rollback-web-push.sql` once before running the current complete schema.
4. In Supabase Auth settings, turn off email confirmation while Resend/email delivery is not configured:
   - Authentication
   - Providers
   - Email
   - Disable `Confirm email`
5. Sign up in the app with the email you want to use as the platform admin.
6. In Supabase SQL Editor, run this once, replacing the email:

```sql
insert into public.app_admins (user_id, email)
select id, lower(email)
from auth.users
where lower(email) = lower('YOUR_ADMIN_EMAIL@example.com')
on conflict (user_id) do nothing;
```

7. Sign out and sign back in. You should now see the admin dashboard.
8. In Supabase Auth settings, add your local and GitHub Pages URLs to allowed redirect URLs:
   - `http://localhost:8000`
   - `https://YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io/YOUR-REPO-NAME/`
9. Open `config.js` and set your publishable Supabase details:

```js
window.MUSHAVO_BUDGET_CONFIG = {
  supabaseUrl: "https://YOUR-PROJECT-REF.supabase.co",
  supabasePublishableKey: "YOUR-SUPABASE-PUBLISHABLE-KEY"
};
```

Use the Supabase publishable key only. Never place the Supabase service-role key or any other server secret in frontend code.

## How Access Works

Anyone can sign up for free and sign in immediately. Free users can create up to 5 personal payments.

Creating a family requires an active membership. The admin controls the maximum number of families the user may own with `family_limit`. A limit of `0` blocks family creation, `1` allows one family, and larger values allow additional families. Platform payment status is not used for this permission.

Only the owner of a family with an active membership and `can_add_members = true` can invite or remove members. The invitation form includes a family dropdown so the owner chooses which owned family the person should join. Family creation, deletion, invitation creation, notification creation, member removal, and invitation responses are handled by protected database functions so the rules cannot be bypassed from the browser.

Invited users do not need an active membership or subscription to join a family. They only need a registered Mushavo Budget login matching the invited email, then they can accept or reject the invitation from `Family & Members`.

Family members must register with Mushavo Budget before they can be invited. If an email has not registered yet, the inviter sees a friendly message asking that person to sign up first.

Removing a member sets their membership record to `inactive`; it does not delete that record. The family owner cannot remove themselves. Reinviting the same registered email can reactivate the retained membership after the user accepts.

Deleting a family is different from removing a member. Only the family owner can delete their family. The family row is permanently deleted from the database, and foreign-key cascades remove its operational family data. The owner's subscription/access row remains so the admin-controlled family limit continues to apply and the owner can create another family if a slot is available.

## Main Household Workflow

1. Sign up, then sign in.
2. Add up to 5 personal payments on the free account.
3. Ask the platform admin to activate your membership and set your family limit.
4. Create a family and add its name, monthly budget, and currency from `Family & Members`.
5. If the admin grants more family slots, create additional families and switch between them from the family selector.
6. Invite registered users by choosing the target family, entering their email, and selecting their role. Members cannot be added manually.
7. The invited user signs in and accepts or rejects the notification from `Family & Members`.
8. Add recurring payments:
   - payment name
   - amount
   - category
   - responsible member
   - recurrence, including custom month or day intervals
   - due day plus the schedule start month and year
   - reminder days
9. Use `Dashboard` to see what is due now and what is coming next month.
10. Open a due item and record either a partial or full payment. Optionally attach a JPG, PNG, WebP, or PDF receipt up to 10 MB, or add payment details.
11. Use `Reports` to review paid rate, outstanding dues, category totals, and history.

## In-App Reminders

The notification bell and Settings inbox show invitations and payment reminders while the user is signed in. Web Push subscriptions, background delivery, VAPID keys, the reminder Edge Function, and the one-minute Cron job are not part of this version.

## Admin Workflow

1. Open Admin `Dashboard` to see household health.
2. Open `Households` to unlock member access, suspend/reactivate households, and see overdue/partial dues.
3. Open `Users` to see every Supabase Auth user and their workspace/access state.
4. Open `Plans` to add or edit plans, public descriptions, feature access, included places, publication status, and real monthly or annual prices.
5. Open `Finance` to review user-submitted payment details and proof. Approval extends the entitlement once, creates a receipt, and records history; rejection requires a reason.
6. Open `Enquiries` to search and filter public messages by status or country, reply by email, and move each record through New, In Progress, Resolved, or Archived.
7. Open `Support` to add internal household support notes.

## Workspace subscriptions

The complete schema now adds a compatibility workspace layer around the existing family and payment tables:

- Every registered user receives one Personal workspace with an active Free entitlement.
- Existing families are backfilled as Household workspaces without deleting or renaming family data.
- Existing family members and invitations are linked to workspace membership and seat usage.
- Free is limited to five active Personal payment items. Completed or inactive items remain in history and do not consume a slot.
- Household and Business plans use workspace-level subscriptions. Invited members inherit access and do not buy separate subscriptions.
- Household includes four people total. Business includes the owner plus five team members. Active pending invitations count toward billing.
- Personal expiry falls back to Free without changing or deleting payment records.
- Expired or suspended Household and Business workspaces remain stored and become read-only.
- Reports stay visible on Free but open a locked upgrade state; plan limits are also checked by database functions.
- Subscription invoices snapshot plan name, billing period, currency, base price, extra-seat price, member count, and total.
- User payment proof is stored in the private `subscription-proofs` bucket. The browser never receives a service-role key.

## Required deployment order for this subscription release

1. Open the Supabase project used by `config.js`.
2. Open **SQL Editor**, create a new query, paste the entire current `supabase/schema.sql`, and run it once. Do not run only the new section.
3. Confirm the query completes without an error. It backfills profiles, Personal workspaces, Household workspaces, owner/member rows, Free/Household subscriptions, workspace links on payment records, and Row Level Security policies.
4. In the app, sign in with a Super Admin account and open **Plans**.
5. Publish a monthly and annual base price for each paid plan and currency you want to offer. The additional-member field is the monthly price per extra person; annual invoices multiply it by 12 automatically.
6. Follow `CURRENCYAPI_DEPLOYMENT.md` to rotate the exposed provider key, store the replacement as a Supabase secret, deploy the protected function, and schedule the twice-daily job.
7. Follow `PUBLIC_WEBSITE_DEPLOYMENT.md` to apply the public-site migrations and verify the direct RLS-protected enquiry workflow.
8. Upload the changed website files while preserving the `assets/` and `supabase/` folders.
9. Reload the website once so the newest service-worker cache takes control.
10. Test with one ordinary user: open **Subscription**, submit payment details and optional proof, then approve it in Admin **Finance**.

Paid plans remain safely unavailable when their price is not configured. Monthly and annual prices are separate effective-dated rows, and old invoices retain their original snapshots after a later price change.

### Payment daily-recurrence update

For an existing database, run only `supabase/migrations/20260905143000_payment_daily_recurrence.sql` in the Supabase SQL Editor before uploading this release. It adds the `custom_days` schedule type and expands the shared interval limit without changing existing payment items or records.

## Multi-currency and exchange rates

- Every original amount remains stored with its original ISO currency code.
- A workspace owner chooses enabled currencies, the default currency for new payments, and a separate reporting currency in Settings.
- New personal workspaces inherit the default and additional currencies selected during signup; those choices remain editable in Settings.
- Original reports group unlike currencies separately. Converted reports use the selected reporting currency and label unpaid totals as estimates.
- Completed user payments and approved Admin Finance payments receive locked conversion records. Later syncs never rewrite those historical conversions.
- The CurrencyAPI key is used only by `supabase/functions/sync-exchange-rates`; it must never be added to `config.js` or any browser file.
- Supabase Cron runs at 00:15 and 12:15 UTC (02:15 and 14:15 Zimbabwe time).
- Deployment, rotation, testing, and troubleshooting steps are in `CURRENCYAPI_DEPLOYMENT.md`.
