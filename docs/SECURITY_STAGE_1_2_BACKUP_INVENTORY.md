# 1.2 — External database and file protection

Started 7 October 2026 after owner-tested normal sign-ins completed in 1.1. Stage 1 remains in progress. Account recovery gaps are carried forward; no provider recovery test or full F08 closure is inferred.

## Current scope and starting facts

Owner baseline: Supabase Free, no owner-held external database/uploaded-file backups and no separate staging project. F16 remains open. S1E09 records the completed Windows executable-version check. S1E12 records the owner choice to use standalone PostgreSQL command-line tools for exports. Next is the owner-run read-only SQL inventory to establish deployed version/scope, followed by existing-client discovery or compatible client installation. No export, restore, package install, local stack, account setting or production write has been performed.

For a recoverable backup we must account for database schema/data/roles and privileges, uploaded file bytes and their database metadata, and separately inventoried Auth/platform/Edge/provider configuration dependencies. Supabase's database-backup guidance distinguishes Storage metadata from actual object bytes and recommends off-site exports for Free projects. The earlier Supabase CLI route has defaults/managed-schema exclusions that differ from standalone PostgreSQL tools. The selected standalone export's actual schema/data/role/privilege/managed scope must be designed explicitly; no CLI flags/defaults are blindly copied. Actual PostgreSQL version and required Auth/Storage coverage must be reconciled before preparing exports.

## First owner check — installed tool versions

Paste the PowerShell block below directly in the existing terminal. It does not need a directory change and uses `npm.cmd` to avoid the blocked `npm.ps1` wrapper. Each discovered executable is called only with `--version`. The output contains tool status/version, not credentials or project data. Missing commands are recorded rather than automatically installed.

The source is [scripts/security-stage-1-tool-inventory.ps1](../scripts/security-stage-1-tool-inventory.ps1). The owner supplied successful Windows execution results on 7 October (S1E09). No PowerShell runtime exists in the audit workspace; no local Windows execution is claimed. The original block is retained below for reproducibility, not as a repeat check request.

```powershell
& {
    foreach ($mushavoTool in @(
        "node", "npm.cmd", "git", "docker", "pg_dump", "psql", "supabase"
    )) {
        $mushavoCommand = Get-Command -Name $mushavoTool `
            -CommandType Application -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
            Select-Object -First 1

        $mushavoStatus = "NOT ON PATH"
        $mushavoVersion = ""

        if ($mushavoCommand) {
            try {
                $mushavoOutput = & $mushavoCommand.Source --version 2>&1
                $mushavoExitCode = $LASTEXITCODE

                if ($mushavoExitCode -eq 0) {
                    $mushavoStatus = "FOUND"
                    $mushavoVersion = ($mushavoOutput | Out-String).Trim()
                } else {
                    $mushavoStatus = "VERSION CHECK FAILED"
                }
            } catch {
                $mushavoStatus = "VERSION CHECK FAILED"
            }
        }

        [pscustomobject]@{
            Tool = $mushavoTool
            Status = $mushavoStatus
            Version = $mushavoVersion
        }
    }
} | Format-Table -Wrap -AutoSize
```

`NOT ON PATH` means no matching executable was found in this shell. It does not prove that an npm-local/cached CLI or non-PATH PostgreSQL installation is absent. If Supabase is normally invoked through `npx.cmd`, report that separately; this check intentionally does not invoke a package runner that could download a CLI. Docker CLI presence does not prove a running/compatible container engine or identify its target. Report results before choosing a backend/export path.

## Owner results — S1E09

| Executable | Observed status | Version |
|---|---|---|
| node | FOUND | v22.17.0 |
| npm.cmd | FOUND | 10.9.2 |
| git | FOUND | git version 2.55.0.windows.3 |
| docker | FOUND | Docker version 29.6.2, build dfc4efb |
| pg_dump | NOT ON PATH | Not established |
| psql | NOT ON PATH | Not established |
| supabase | FOUND | 2.106.0 |

The executable inventory completed at owner-tested scope. No version check failed. The repository devDependency pins Supabase CLI 2.116.0; this is distinct from the owner's PATH-resolved 2.106.0. No automatic upgrade, dependency edit or assumption that the installed CLI supports every current documented flag follows. PostgreSQL executable absence on PATH is not a backup failure, and Docker's `--version` does not prove engine readiness. No backup/restore PASS is inferred.

## Earlier engine/help results — S1E11 (historical)

Owner output on 7 October selects `desktop-linux`, but `docker version` returns client 29.6.2, no server version and a missing `dockerDesktopLinuxEngine` named pipe. **FAIL at selected-engine readiness scope / container export path BLOCKED.** The cause is not established: Docker Desktop may be stopped, still starting or unable to initialize. CLI installation remains proven separately; a missing pipe is not a hosted Supabase database failure.

Bare `supabase db dump --help` selected the npm `supabase.ps1` wrapper and was blocked by PowerShell's execution policy before the CLI help ran. **CLI options NOT VERIFIED / wrapper invocation BLOCKED**, not an absent executable or failed export. The assistant's original bare-command instruction was incorrect for the already known PowerShell policy. The corrected block resolves an Application executable exactly as the successful version inventory did, avoiding the `.ps1` wrapper; use this or an explicitly available `.cmd`/`.exe` for future CLI instructions. No policy weakening or automatic CLI upgrade is requested.

## Selected export route — S1E12

Owner instruction on 7 October: **use PostgreSQL command**. Use Windows PostgreSQL client tools directly for database exports; Docker startup and Supabase CLI dump/help are no longer prerequisites for this selected export route. S1E11's engine failure and wrapper blocker remain historical evidence, not repaired PASS. Docker's role in any later optional local staging proposal is a separate decision; no container-based environment is assumed or started.

The planned tools are `pg_dump` for selected database content, `pg_dumpall` for the selected global-role scope where permitted, `pg_restore` for archive inspection/isolated recovery and `psql` for read-only connection checks and selected script recovery. These are not yet verified as installed/compatible. The original probe found pg_dump/psql not on PATH, which does not rule out a non-PATH installation.

Prefer the deployed server's supported major version for the Windows clients and isolated recovery target. PostgreSQL documents that pg_dump refuses a server newer than its own major version; a newer client's output is also not guaranteed to restore to an older server. Establish the actual hosted version before selecting a client download/installation. PostgreSQL's official Windows download page links to supported EDB installers and binary archives; installing a local server is not required merely to run clients against Supabase. Exact available-client paths, versions and help/options must be checked before preparing exports. No automatic installation or change to the native project dependencies is performed by this decision.

Database connection host/port/username will come from the intended project's Dashboard Connect panel. Prefer a supported direct connection, or reconcile session-pooler fallback for an IPv4-only owner network; do not guess the pooler host or use a transaction-pooler URL for a dump. Credentials, SSL certificate/verification settings, selected scope and owner-held protected destination remain export prerequisites. No connection string or password is requested in this inventory handoff.

## Next owner check — deployed PostgreSQL and backup scope

The existing Dashboard SQL inventory works independently of Docker and local PostgreSQL client installation. Collect its results first; then discover any compatible existing Windows clients or give the version-specific client installation instructions. No engine startup or CLI help rerun is requested for this route.

The deployed SQL source is [security_stage_1_backup_inventory.sql](../supabase/diagnostics/security_stage_1_backup_inventory.sql). Copy it using the owner's established handoff below. Fetch/show does not merge, reset or change the original native checkout's tracked files.

```powershell
& {
    Set-Location "C:\Users\HP\Desktop\Mushavo Budget"

    git fetch origin security/stage-1-foundations
    if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) { throw "Fetch failed." }

    git show "FETCH_HEAD:supabase/diagnostics/security_stage_1_backup_inventory.sql" |
        Out-String | Set-Clipboard
    if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) { throw "SQL copy failed." }

    Write-Output "Read-only Stage 1.2 inventory SQL copied."
}
```

In the Supabase Dashboard, verify the intended project reference **kttkospkblwvguuwnhjj**; open SQL Editor, use its `postgres` role, create a new query, paste and run. Send the full result table (CSV is fine), or the exact error if it fails. Expected output is **13 inventory rows: 12 INFO and 1 REVIEW**. Those labels mean evidence collection, not successful protection or restore. Database/catalog metadata cannot independently prove the Dashboard project reference.

The SQL uses a repeatable-read, read-only transaction with 30-second statement and 3-second lock timeouts, then rolls back. It reports deployed PostgreSQL/database size, non-system schema/extension/role metadata, privilege indicators, Auth user count, bucket configuration, object counts/recorded sizes, managed trigger/policy metadata, publication indicators and presence of scheduler/encryption/migration dependencies. Missing or malformed object sizes stay explicit unknowns. It returns no user emails/IDs, file paths/contents, passwords, routine bodies, cron commands, webhook URLs or decrypted secret values. Standard Supabase Auth/Storage tables and owner SQL permissions are prerequisites; report errors instead of interpreting unavailable results as empty scope.

This metadata is not a full configuration inventory. Auth/SMTP/Edge/provider settings, precise grants, custom managed definitions, encryption keys and actual object integrity remain separate dependencies. Each export's data/role/managed-schema behavior will be checked against actual CLI options and deployed version; a successful default schema dump is not complete recovery coverage.

## Local validation — S1E10

[verify-security-stage-1-backup-inventory.cjs](../scripts/verify-security-stage-1-backup-inventory.cjs) executes the diagnostic against disposable PGlite PostgreSQL fixtures, with no network or hosted credentials. It checks the 13-row INFO/REVIEW contract, read-only/repeatable-read context, counts, empty inventories, invalid/missing/negative/oversized size metadata, managed trigger/policy indicators, omission of seeded private values and rejection of writes in a read-only transaction. The fixture passed; S1E11 records the historical engine/wrapper blockers; S1E12 selects standalone PostgreSQL exports. Hosted execution remains pending. This is SQL preparation evidence, not a production backup or recovery test.

## Work after this inventory

1. Establish the deployed PostgreSQL version/scope, then locate compatible existing Windows pg_dump/pg_dumpall/pg_restore/psql clients or prepare version-specific installation and executable-path instructions. No dependency edits or Docker/CLI-help prerequisite is required for this selected route.
2. Obtain the deployed PostgreSQL version, selected schema/role scope and aggregate Storage/configuration inventory using the read-only diagnostic above. SQL handoffs remain PowerShell fetch → `git show "FETCH_HEAD:<path>" | Out-String | Set-Clipboard` → owner manual Supabase paste. Hosted results remain pending.
3. Prepare compatible standalone PostgreSQL database export and separately authorized file-byte export paths. Require explicit target identity, connection method, completeness scope and separate credentials handling; do not embed credentials in pasted history, git or reports.
4. Agree owner-held protected off-site storage, recovery targets, frequency/retention and completion/failure records using actual size/volume. Prepare concrete commands only after these dependencies are known. A schema file or object metadata alone is insufficient.
5. Review owner-held artifact counts, scope/integrity and incomplete-run detection. Isolated restore proof is step 1.4; a live production restore is not part of this work.

Only redacted outcome/size/date/completeness records enter the repository. Customer database/file bytes and recovery credentials stay with the owner. An export that succeeds without its required scope stays incomplete, not PASS.
